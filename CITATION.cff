  DiaMetrics (lite) is a web-based educational resource for exploring 
  important concepts regarding binary classification (and its 
  evaluation), which is important in many different fields such as 
  psychodiagnostics (e.g. in determining cut-off values for tests), 
  machine learning or medical testing. The lite version is primarily 
  intended for use with direct instruction (e.g. in the context of 
  lectures or talks).
